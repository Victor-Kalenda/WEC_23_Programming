2023 Waterloo Engineering Competition Programming Solution

In this implementation a linked list of truckers is designed, each trucker in this linked list inherits a linked list of
trips outlining each journey a trucker has taken throughout the week. Each journey logs the data required to output a
valid solution to json_solution_output.json.

CSV_Solution.cpp contains the remnants of a past question when we initially developed the problem. This implementation
takes csv files as input, which turned out to be far too complicated to implement. For this reason, the input files were
change to json files to allow contestants to spend more time solving the problem.

Taking distance.json and input.json as input, input.json being generated by stage3-5.py, the following code successfully
delivers 100 packages amoung 10 locations. Rush hour traffic simulation and late delivery logging is accounted for with
truckers being limited from working more than 14 hours a day, and 70 hours a week.
